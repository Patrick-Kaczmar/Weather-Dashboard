# Weather-Dashboard

A weather dashboard application that displays the current weather conditions for the searched city. Includes a five day forcast with icons that describe the weather conditions for that day. Local storage is used after each search to save the parameters needed to search the last city input by the user.

Bootstrap was used to create premade card classes for the saved cities list, the current weather dashboard and the future forcast.

## All api's used came from the open weather map website - https://openweathermap.org/api
